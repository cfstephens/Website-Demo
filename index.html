                  <p>As an artist, I try to make work that would not only entertain but impact me if I were the viewer. I often work with very illustrative but also sculptural feeling. I also work with many whimsical and surrealistic elements. For example putting my subjects into dream-like states, for example my identity piece as well as my visual mashup piece. I also like to incorporate disturbing and unsettling images, for example a fish being graphically gutted but presented in a casual manner. I also use imagery like animal heads on sexualized bodies to create commentary on objectification while making the viewer feel unsettled by it. The ideas of death and destruction have always fascinated me as it is inevitable, and I like to incorporate those ideas into my work through motifs like graveyards, death, and drowning show up quite a bit. I also like to work with a voyeuristic point of view especially with women, as seen in my visual mashup piece which gives the viewer an almost uncomfortable viewpoint of a very casual but absurd moment in time. Mostly, my work is focused on unsettling absurdism as that is what has always provoked and entertained me as an artist, taking cues from masters such as Hannah Hoch and Kurt Schwitters.</p>
